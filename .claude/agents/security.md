Review code for vulnerabilities and ensure security best practices.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Code Review**: Identify security vulnerabilities
2. **Authentication**: Verify auth implementation
3. **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive data is protected
4. **Input Validation**: Check for injection vulnerabilities

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Web Security
- SQL Injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Authentication bypass
- Insecure direct object references

### Best Practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Apply least privilege principle

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Authentication required where needed
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Security headers configured
