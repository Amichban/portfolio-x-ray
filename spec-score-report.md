- **Assessment Method**: Define error handling, validation, fallback behavior

### 9. Performance (0-10)
Performance criteria and constraints must be defined
- **Target**: ≥ 7.0
- **Assessment Method**: Specify response times, throughput, scalability needs

### 10. Security (0-10)
Security requirements must be addressed
- **Target**: ≥ 7.0

## Portfolio X-Ray Context

Based on the project name "Portfolio X-Ray", future user stories should address:

### Core Functionality Areas
1. **Portfolio Data Import/Integration**
   - Connect to brokerage APIs
   - Import transaction history
   - Real-time data feeds

2. **Portfolio Analytics**
   - Asset allocation analysis
   - Performance metrics
   - Risk assessment
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Customizable charts
   - Export capabilities
   - Alert systems

4. **User Management**
   - Authentication
   - Portfolio management
   - User preferences
   - Data privacy

### Quality Thresholds for Portfolio X-Ray Stories

#### Financial Data Context
- **EUR_USD and D timeframe** requirements per user instructions
- Real-time data accuracy requirements
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Data security and encryption standards

#### Performance Requirements
- Sub-second response times for portfolio updates
- Handle concurrent users efficiently
- Scalable architecture for growing portfolios

#### Integration Requirements
- Multiple broker API integrations
- Market data provider connections
- External authentication systems

## Recommendations for Future Story Creation

### 1. Story Template Structure
```markdown
# [Story Title]

## User Story
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Error handling criterion]

## Technical Requirements
- API endpoints needed
- Data models required
- Performance criteria

## Dependencies
- External services
- Other stories
- Infrastructure needs

## Definition of Done
- Unit tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- Security review complete
- Performance benchmarks met
```

### 2. Portfolio-Specific Considerations
- Include EUR_USD forex data handling
- Specify D (daily) timeframe requirements
- Define real-time vs batch processing needs
- Address regulatory requirements (MiFID II, GDPR)

### 3. Quality Gates
- All stories must score ≥ 7.0 before development
- Peer review required for complex financial calculations
- Security review mandatory for data handling stories
- Performance testing required for real-time features

## Next Steps

1. **Create Initial User Stories**
   - Start with core portfolio viewing functionality
   - Include EUR_USD data integration story
   - Add user authentication story

2. **Apply Spec Scoring**
   - Use this framework to evaluate each story
   - Iterate until all stories achieve ≥ 7.0 score

3. **Prioritize Development**
   - Begin with highest-scoring, highest-value stories
   - Identify parallel development opportunities

## Status Summary

- **Stories Assessed**: 0 (directory empty)
- **Stories Ready (≥ 7.0)**: 0
- **Stories Needing Enhancement**: 0
- **Overall Project Readiness**: Awaiting story creation
