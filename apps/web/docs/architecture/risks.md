### Risk Assessment Methodology

**Risk Scoring Matrix**:
```yaml
risk_scoring:
  probability_scale:
    very_low: 0.05    # 5% chance
    low: 0.15         # 15% chance  
    medium: 0.35      # 35% chance
    high: 0.65        # 65% chance
    very_high: 0.85   # 85% chance
    
  impact_scale:
    negligible: 1     # Minimal impact
    minor: 2          # Limited impact
    moderate: 3       # Significant impact
    major: 4          # Severe impact
    catastrophic: 5   # Business-threatening
    
  risk_calculation:
    formula: "probability × impact = risk_score"
    risk_levels:
      low: "0-5"
      medium: "6-10"
      high: "11-15"
      critical: "16-25"
```
