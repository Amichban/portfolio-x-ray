## Critical Path Analysis

### Must Complete First (Weeks 1-2)
1. **US-001, US-002** - Authentication system (blocks all user-specific features)
2. **Project infrastructure** - Database setup, API framework, CI/CD

### Can Start in Parallel (Week 3)
1. **Track 2** - Risk calculations (using mock data)
2. **Track 3** - CSV processing
3. **Track 4** - Portfolio management

### Later Dependencies (Weeks 6+)
1. **Track 5** - Dashboard (needs portfolio APIs)
2. **Track 6** - Concentration analysis (needs portfolio data)
3. **Track 7** - Advanced analytics (needs core calculations)

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Optimal Team Structure
- **2 Backend Developers** - One on auth/infrastructure, one on risk calculations
- **2 Frontend Developers** - One on data input, one on dashboard/visualization  
- **1 Full-Stack Developer** - Portfolio management and integration
- **1 Quantitative Analyst** - Risk calculations and validation
- **1 UI/UX Designer** - Interface design and user experience

### MVP Delivery Strategy
Focus on these tracks for fastest MVP delivery:
1. Track 1 (Weeks 1-3) - Authentication foundation
2. Track 3 (Weeks 3-6) - Data input capabilities
3. Track 4 (Weeks 4-7) - Portfolio management
4. Track 2 (Weeks 2-8) - Basic risk calculations
5. Track 5 (Weeks 6-10) - Essential dashboard features

## Risk Mitigation

### Integration Points
- **Week 4:** Integration testing between auth and portfolio systems
- **Week 6:** Integration testing between portfolio data and risk calculations
- **Week 8:** Frontend-backend integration testing
- **Week 10:** End-to-end system testing

### Potential Conflicts
1. **Database Schema Changes** - Coordinate between tracks 1, 2, and 4
2. **API Contract Changes** - Establish contracts early, use API versioning
3. **Shared Components** - Create component library early in development

### Communication Strategy
- **Daily standups** across all tracks
- **Weekly integration meetings** for cross-track coordination
- **Shared documentation** for API contracts and data models
- **Feature flags** for safe deployment of parallel work

## Success Metrics

### Velocity Tracking
- Story completion rate per track
- Integration delay metrics  
- Defect rates by parallel track
- Code review cycle times

### Quality Gates
- All stories must pass acceptance criteria
- Integration tests must pass before merging
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Security review required for auth track

This parallel development strategy enables a 6-person team to deliver the MVP in 10-12 weeks instead of the typical 16-20 weeks of sequential development.
