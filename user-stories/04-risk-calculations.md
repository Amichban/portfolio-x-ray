- [ ] Given Sharpe ratio, when displayed, then I see comparison to S&P 500 Sharpe ratio
- [ ] Given different time periods, when I select 1Y, 3Y, 5Y, then Sharpe ratio adjusts for period
- [ ] Given current risk-free rate, when calculating, then 10-year Treasury rate is used as baseline
- [ ] Given Sharpe ratio results, when shown, then I see interpretation guide (excellent >3, good >1, poor <1)
- [ ] Given insufficient return history, when calculation fails, then I see minimum data requirements

**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** M
